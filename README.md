# Right To Know [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/openaustralia/righttoknow.svg?label=ready&title=Ready)](http://waffle.io/openaustralia/righttoknow)

[Right To Know](https://www.righttoknow.org.au/) lets you make and browse
Freedom of Information (FOI) requests in Australia. It is powered by the open
source FOI request platform [Alaveteli](http://www.alaveteli.org/).

This repository contains the the theme package for Alaveteli for the Australian
deployment. If you find a problem with Right to Know, please report it to this
repository's
[issue tracker](https://github.com/openaustralia/righttoknow/issues).

Development
-----------

To get the most benefits from open source and be good open source citizens we
use [upstream Alaveteli](https://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli) and not a fork.
If there is a bug in the core software that can be shared by all we will make
the fix in our repository and open a pull request. In the vast majority of cases
we will not deploy a fix until it's been accepted upstream. This ensures we're
all using the same code as much as possible.

However if you'd like to adjust the look and feel of Right To Know, or to update
copy like that found on the help pages, this is the place to make those changes.

To get a development copy up-and-running, follow the
[Alaveteli installation instructions](http://alaveteli.org/docs/installing/)
and then install this theme. You can read more about themes and how to install
them in the [Alaveteli documentation](http://alaveteli.org/docs/customising/themes/).

Contributing
------------

If you want to modify the customised look and feel of Right To Know then you
should edit this repository however if it's something more general you probably
want to edit the upstream
[core Alaveteli software](https://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli/).

To contribute an enhancement or a fix to this theme:

* Fork the project on GitHub.
* Make a topic branch from the `production` branch.
* Make your changes and test.
* Commit the changes without making changes to any files that aren't related to your enhancement or fix.
* Send a pull request against the `production` branch.

Authorities
-----------

### Adding new authorities

#### Should an agency be added?

Not everything that the government considers to be a distinct agency is an
entity that people actually want to make requests to. It is very much a
subjective call, but always try and make the site most useful to the people who
use it. If there is a lot of unnecessary sub-division authorities for example,
requests will be more difficult to find in the site. Try to avoid this.
For example, the IT division or the head office of an agency are probably
just part of the agency itself for the purpose of information requests.

If a sub-department agency has a distinct office, it’s own website and
information request email address, and does stuff that people would want to make
requests about, it should probably be a distinct authority in Right To Know.

If in doubt, ask the team.

#### Format of state name in authority names

For state authorities often the name of the state appears in the name of the authority.

On the [_Art Gallery of NSW_ website](http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/about-us/) they refer to their own name in three different forms: _Art Gallery NSW_, _Art Gallery of New South Wales_, and _Art Gallery of NSW_. We're currently using [_Art Gallery of NSW_](https://www.righttoknow.org.au/body/agnsw) because it is commonly used, succinct, and searchable. Therefore if the name of the state is in the name of the authority, use the form they use or the form in most common use.

When you need to choose, use real acronyms (NSW, ACT, WA, SA, NT) but not contractions (use Victoria, Tasmania, and Queensland, not VIC, TAS, or QLD).

#### Request email

When collecting the email address that requests to the authority are sent to, we need to find the
best address to deal with them directly. A specific address for the authority
isn’t always available, especially when they exist within a bigger department.
This is the order of preference for the authority’s request email:

1. Specific FOI address for sub-department agency (e.g.
   foi@special_agency.gov.au)
2. Specific address for sub-department agency at department (e.g.
   special_agency@department.gov.au)
3. Specific FOI address for department (e.g. foi@department.gov.au)
4. Generic address for department (e.g. info@department.gov.au)
5. Address for a specific person at the agency (e.g. jane.zhang@dept.gov.au)

A person’s address is the absolute last resort.

#### Public notes

You can add public notes about the authority. The notes are displayed on
the authority’s page, as an excerpt in lists of authorities, and as a highlighted
notice when someone makes a request to the authority. They are covered in the site search.

The note could include important information about requesting from this
department, key terms people might use when searching for the agency, and a
basic description of the authority. For example:

> HomeStart was created by the South Australian Government in 1989,
> as a response to high interest rates and a lack of affordable home loan
> finance options. HomeStart was established as a statutory corporation under
> the Housing and Urban Development (Administrative Arrangements) Act 1995 and
> reports to the Minister for Housing and Urban Development.

#### Short name

You can add abbreviated version of the authority’s name as it’s *short name*.
These are really useful because the common name for an agency might not be it’s
full formal name. For example, people commonly search “ABS” when looking for
the “Australian Bureau of Statistics”.

It’s very important to only add acronyms or abbreviations that people *really* do use.
These are displayed on authority pages and lists of authorities, and having lots
of irrelevant short names adds unnecessary noise to the page.

#### Removing an authority

Authorities that are defunct aren’t actually removed from Right To Know.
Add the `defunct` tag to the authority and it will no longer be available for requests.
People can still find requests to the authority in search results and see all
the requests that were made to them while they were active.

### Jurisdictions

A unique aspect of Right To Know compared to other Alaveteli installations is
that we're in the process of supporting 9 different jurisdictions - Federal and
all the states and territories.

We have customisations in this theme to adjust the length of time authorities
have to respond to a request and the law names depending on what jurisdiction
an authority is covered by. These customisations rely on the use of Alaveteli's
tags to work out what jurisdiction an authority is covered by.

The table below show what tag you need to use for each jurisdiction. Don't
forget to also add the appropriate category tag, described in the section
below, for the authority you're adding.

| Jurisdiction | Tag       |
|--------------|-----------|
| Federal      | `federal` |
| ACT          | `ACT`     |
| NSW          | `NSW`     |
| NT           | `NT`      |
| QLD          | `QLD`     |
| SA           | `SA`      |
| TAS          | `TAS`     |
| VIC          | `VIC`     |
| WA           | `WA`      |

### Categories

Public authority categories are configured in the Alaveteli admin interface.
