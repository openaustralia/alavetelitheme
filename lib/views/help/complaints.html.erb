      How do we deal with complaints about us?

      <p>
        If you have a complaint about the way we are running the <%= site_name %>
        website, please <a href="<%=  help_contact_path %>">tell us</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <%= site_name %> volunteers will seek to apply the siteâ€™s existing
        policies or discuss adapting the policies to respond to any novel
        circumstances which arise.
      </p>
      <p>
        We endeavour to deal with complaints promptly, however some cases raise
        unique issues which require further consideration. We may take time to
        discuss the case in one of our regular team meetings or seek advice.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're unhappy with a decision made by the <%= site_name %> team,
        you may ask for the decision to be reviewed internally with a group
        including a director of the OpenAustralia Foundation.
        <%= site_name %> is a project of the OpenAustralia Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, the directors of the OpenAustralia Foundation are
        responsible for the running of <%= site_name %> and will make the final
        decision in relation to any complaint.
