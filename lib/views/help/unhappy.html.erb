<p>... you can</p>

<h1 id="internal_review">1. Asking for an internal review <a class="hover_a" href="#internal_review">#</a> </h1>
<p>In an internal review the request goes back to the original authority but gets handled by a <a href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/publications/guidelines/guidelines-part9_guidelines-internal-review.html#_Toc287345401">different, usually more senior, officer</a>.</p>

<% else %>
    At the bottom of the relevant request page on <%= site_name %> choose
    "request an internal review". Then write a message asking for an internal
    review of your request. You may want to include a link to the
    request page, to make it clear which request you are talking about.

</p>

<p>Internal reviews are free and should be pretty quick. It should take no longer than 30 calendar days.

<h1 id="complaining">2. Information Commissioner <a class="hover_a" href="#complaining">#</a> </h1>

<p>If you are still unhappy after the public authority has done their internal review,
then you can ask the Commissioner responsible managing FOI in your state (or the OAIC for Federal FOI requests)
to review the decision or make a complaint.
You don't have to go through an internal review before going to the Information Commissioner
but they do recommend it.
</p>

<p> To make a complaint, contact the relevant authority from the list below:</p>
  <ul>
<li> Federal - <a href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/">Office of the Australian Information Commissioner</a></li>
<li> NSW - <a href="http://www.ipc.nsw.gov.au/privacy/public_media/accessing_information.html">Information and Privacy Commissioner</a></li>
<li> VIC - <a href="http://www.foicommissioner.vic.gov.au">Freedom of Information Commissioner</a></li>
<li> QLD - <a href="http://www.oic.qld.gov.au">Office of the Information Commissioner</a></li>
<li> TAS - <a href="http://www.ombudsman.tas.gov.au/right_to_information/process">Ombudsman Tasmania</a></li>
<li> SA - <a href="http://www.archives.sa.gov.au/foi/">State Records of SA</a></li>
<li> WA - <a href="http://www.foi.wa.gov.au/dnn/home.aspx">Office of the Information Commissioner</a></li>
<li> NT - <a href="http://www.privacy.nt.gov.au/foi/index.htm">Office of the Information Commissioner</a></li>
<li> ACT - <a href="http://www.cmd.act.gov.au/open_government/report/freedom_of_information_online">ACT Open Government</a></li>
  </ul>

<p>To make it easier to send the relevant information to the
Information Commissioner, either
<% if !@info_request.nil? %>
    include a link to your request
    <strong><%=h request_url(@info_request) %></strong>
<% else %>
    include a link to your request on <%= site_name %>
<% end %>
in your complaint or print out the whole page of your request and all attachments.
</p>

<p>Asking for a review or making a complaint is free.</p>

<p><%= site_name %> has no special facilities for handling a request at this stage - it
passes into the Information Commissioner's system. You can leave annotations on your
request keeping people informed of progress.</p>

<h1 id="other_means">3. Using other means to answer your question <a class="hover_a" href="#other_means">#</a> </h1>

<p>You can try persuing your problem or your research in other ways.

<ul>
<li>Make a <strong>new Freedom of Information request</strong> for summary information, or for
documentation relating indirectly to matters in your refused request.
<a href="/help/contact">Ask us for ideas</a> if you're stuck.</li>
<li>If any <strong>other public authorities</strong> or publicly owned companies are involved,
then make Freedom of Information requests to them.</li>
<li>Write to <strong>your MP</strong> or other politician and ask for their help
finding the answer. MPs can write directly to ministers or departments, and
can ask written questions in Parliament.</li>
<li>Ask <strong>other researchers</strong> who are interested in a similar
issue to yours for ideas. You can sometimes find them by browsing this site;
contact any registered user from their page. There may be an Internet
forum or group that they hang out in.</li>
</ul>
