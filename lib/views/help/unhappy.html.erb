<li>You did not get all of the information that you requested <strong>or</strong></li>
<li>Your request was refused, but without a reason valid under the law</li>

<p>... you can</p>

<li>Ask for an <strong>internal review</strong> at the public authority.</li>

<h1 id="internal_review">1. Asking for an internal review <a class="hover_a" href="#internal_review">#</a> </h1>
<p>In an internal review the request goes back to the original authority but gets handled by a <a href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/freedom-of-information/applying-the-foi-act/foi-guidelines/part-9-internal-agency-review-of-decisions2#procedures">different, usually more senior, officer</a>.</p>

<% else %>
    At the bottom of the relevant request page on <%= site_name %> choose
    "request an internal review". Then write a message asking for an internal
    review of your request. You may want to include a link to the
    request page, to make it clear which request you are talking about.
<% end %>
</p>

<p>Internal reviews are free and should be pretty quick. It should take no longer than 30 calendar days. See the
  <a href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/freedom-of-information/applying-the-foi-act/foi-guidelines/part-9-internal-agency-review-of-decisions2#procedures">Information Commissioner Guidelines</a> for the specifics.
</p>

<h1 id="complaining">2. Information Commissioner <a class="hover_a" href="#complaining">#</a> </h1>

<p>If you are still unhappy after the public authority has done their internal review,
then you can ask the Information Commissioner to review the decision or make a complaint. You don't have to go through an internal review before going to the Information Commissioner but they do recommend it.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  If you were unsatisfied with the previous decision you should ask for a review of the decision. To do this read
  <a href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/freedom-of-information/foi-reviews">FOI reviews</a> on the Information Commissioner's website.
</li>
<li>
  If you didn't get a reply within 30 days, or are in some other way dissatisfied with the authority's handling of your request and want to make a complaint against the authority then read <a href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/freedom-of-information/foi-complaints">FOI complaints</a> on the Information Commissioner's website.
</li>
</ul>

<p>To make it easier to send the relevant information to the
Information Commissioner, either
<% if !@info_request.nil? %>
    include a link to your request
    <strong><%=h request_url(@info_request) %></strong>
<% else %>
    include a link to your request on <%= site_name %>
<% end %>
in your complaint or print out the whole page of your request and all attachments.
</p>

<p>Asking for a review or making a complaint at the Information Commissioner is free.</p>

<p><%= site_name %> has no special facilities for handling a request at this stage - it
passes into the Information Commissioner's system. You can leave annotations on your
request keeping people informed of progress.</p>

<h1 id="other_means">3. Using other means to answer your question <a class="hover_a" href="#other_means">#</a> </h1>

<p>You can try persuing your problem or your research in other ways.

<ul>
<li>Make a <strong>new Freedom of Information request</strong> for summary information, or for
documentation relating indirectly to matters in your refused request.
<a href="/help/contact">Ask us for ideas</a> if you're stuck.</li>
<li>If any <strong>other public authorities</strong> or publicly owned companies are involved,
then make Freedom of Information requests to them.</li>
<li>Write to <strong>your MP</strong> or other politician and ask for their help
finding the answer. MPs can write directly to ministers or departments, and
can ask written questions in Parliament.</li>
<li>Ask <strong>other researchers</strong> who are interested in a similar
issue to yours for ideas. You can sometimes find them by browsing this site;
contact any registered user from their page. There may be an Internet
forum or group that they hang out in.</li>
</ul>
