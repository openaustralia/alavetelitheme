<dt id="top">I just got here from bottom of an FOI request, what is going on? <a href="#top">#</a> </dt>

<dd><p><%= site_name %> is a service run by a charity. It helps ordinary members
of the public make FOI requests, and easily track and share the responses.</p>

<p>The FOI request you received was made by someone using <%= site_name %>. You can
simply reply to the request as you would any other request from an individual.
The only difference is that your response will be automatically published on
the Internet.
</p>
<p>If you have privacy or other concerns, please read the answers below.
You might also like to read the <a
href="/help/about">introduction to <%= site_name %></a> to find out more about what
the site does from the point of view of a user. You can also search the
site to find the authority that you work for, and view the status of
any requests made using the site.

<p>Finally, we welcome comments and
thoughts from FOI officers, please <a href="/help/contact">get in touch</a>.
</p>
</dd>

<dt id="responses">Why are you publishing responses to FOI requests? <a href="#responses">#</a> </dt>

<dd>We think there are lots of benefits. Most importantly it will encourage the
public to be more interested and involved in the work of government. We
also hope that it will reduce the number of duplicate requests on any
subject that a public body will receive. Given that Freedom of Information
responses contain public information, which anybody could easily request
again from the public authority, we think there should be no reason not to
publish it widely.
</dd>

<dt id="pdf">Why should I not send PDF documents in FOI responses? <a href="#pdf">#</a> </dt>
<dd>
  The <a href="http://webguide.gov.au/accessibility-usability/accessibility/pdf-accessibility/">Australian Government Webguide</a> makes it very clear that PDF is not an acceptable format for you to use in the delivery of government information:
  <blockquote>
    PDF does not yet have approved Sufficient Techniques to claim WCAG 2.0 conformance, so it cannot be ‘relied upon’ in the provision of government information.
  </blockquote>
  Write a response in an email as plain text. This is not only a simple and efficient way for you to conform to government guidelines, it is easier and quicker for the recipient to read.
</dd>

<dt id="realpeople">Are the people making requests real people? <a href="#realpeople">#</a> </dt>

<dd>Yes. For the purposes of keeping track of responses we use
computer-generated email addresses for each request. However, before
they can send a request, each user must register on the site with a
unique email address that we then verify. You can search this site and
find a page listing all requests that each person has made.
</dd>

<dt id="vexatious">Aren't you making lots of vexatious requests? <a href="#vexatious">#</a> </dt>

<dd><p><%= site_name %> is not making any requests. We are sending requests on
behalf of our users, who are real people making the requests. </p>
<p>Look at it like this - if lots of different people made requests from
different Hotmail email addresses, then you would not think that Microsoft were
making vexatious requests. It is exactly the same if lots of requests are made
via <%= site_name %>. Moreover, since all requests are public it is much easier
for you to see if one of our users is making vexatious requests. </p>
</dd>

<dt id="spam_problems">I can see a request on <%= site_name %>, but we never got it by email! <a href="#spam_problems">#</a> </dt>

<dd><p>If a request appears on the site, then we have attempted to send it to
the authority by email. Any delivery failure messages will automatically
appear on the site. You can check the address we're using with the "View FOI
email address" link which appears on the page for the authority. <a
href="/help/contact">Contact us</a> if there is a better address we can
use.</p>
<p>Requests are sometimes not delivered because they are quietly removed by
"spam filters" in the IT department of the authority. Authorities can make
sure this doesn't happen by asking their IT departments to "whitelist"
any email from <strong>@<%= Configuration::incoming_email_domain %></strong>.
If you <a href="/help/contact">ask us</a> we will resend any request,
and/or give technical details of delivery so an IT department can chase
up what happened to the message.
</p>
<p>Finally, you can respond to any request from your web browser, without
needing any email, using the "respond to request" link at the bottom of
each request page.
</dd>

<dt id="days">How do you calculate the deadline shown on request pages? <a href="#days">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
  <p>The Freedom of Information Act says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <em>
        &hellip;the agency or Minister must&hellip;as soon as practicable but in
        any case not later than the end of the period of 30 days after the day on
        which the request is received by or on behalf of the agency or Minister,
        take all reasonable steps to enable the applicant to be notified of a
        decision on the request
      </em>
      &mdash;
      <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/foia1982222/s15.html">(s 15(5)(b))</a>
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    And we try to be as generous as possible in our calculation of the 30 day
    timeframe.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt id="large_file">How can I send a large file, which won't go by email? <a href="#large_file">#</a> </dt>

<dd>Instead of email, you can respond to a request directly from your web
browser, including uploading a file. To do this, choose "respond to request" at
the bottom of the request's page. <a href="/help/contact">Contact us</a> if it
is too big for even that (more than, say, 50Mb).
</dd>

<dt id="names">Why do you publish the names of public servants and the text of emails? <a href="#names">#</a> </dt>

<dd>We consider what officers or servants do in the course of their employment
to be public information. We will only remove content in exceptional
circumstances, see our <a href="/help/privacy#takedown">take down policy</a>.
</dd>

<dt id="mobiles">Do you publish email addresses or mobile phone numbers? <a href="#mobiles">#</a> </dt>

<dd><p>To prevent spam, we automatically remove most emails and some mobile numbers from
responses to requests.  Please <a href="/help/contact">contact us</a> if we've
missed one.
For technical reasons we don't always remove them from attachments, such as certain PDFs.</p>
<p>If you need to know what an address was that we've removed, please <a
  href="/help/contact">get in touch with us</a>. Occasionally, an email address
forms an important part of a response and we will post it up in an obscured
form in an annotation.
</dd>

<dt id="copyright"><a name="commercial"></a>What is your policy on copyright of documents? <a href="#copyright">#</a> </dt>

<dd>Our Freedom of Information law is "applicant blind", so anyone in the
world can request the same document and get a copy of it.

If you think our making a document available on the internet infringes your
copyright, you may <a href="/help/contact">contact us</a> and ask us
to take it down.  However, to save tax payers' money by preventing duplicate
requests, and for good public relations, we'd advise you not to do that.
