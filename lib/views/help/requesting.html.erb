<p>It can be hard to untangle government's complicated structures, and work out
who knows the information that you want. Here are a few tips:
<ul>
<li>Browse or search <%= site_name %> looking for similar requests to yours.</li>
<li>When you've found an authority you think might have the information, use
the "home page" link on the right hand side of their page to check what they do
on their website.</li>
<li>Contact the authority by phone or email to ask if they hold the kind of
information you're after.</li>
<li>Don't worry excessively about getting the right authority. If you get it
wrong, Federal authorities will <a href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/publications/guidelines/Part3_processing_requests_for_access.html#_Toc299022275">transfer your request to the correct authority</a> for you.
Most <i>(Possibly all)</i> State authorities will also transfer requests. If they don't, you can always ask for help.
</li>
<li>If you've got a thorny case, please feel free to <a href="/help/contact">contact us</a> for help.</li>
</ul>

</dd>
<dt id="who">Who can make a request? <a href="#who">#</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>
Any person, of any nationality, anywhere in the world, however young or old can make a request under the various Freedom of Information (FOI) laws which apply in Australia.
</p>
<p>
The Freedom of Information Act (for federal authorities) simply says that "every person has a legally enforceable right to obtain access in accordance with this Act". A "person" can also be a body corporate, such as a company.
</p>
<p>
See the Information Commissioner's Guidelines <a href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/publications/guidelines/Part3_processing_requests_for_access.html#_Toc299022249">Right of Access</a> for more information on federal FOI.
</p>
</dd>

<dt id="missing_body">You're missing the public authority that I want to request from! <a href="#missing_body">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
<p>At the moment we aim to cover all Australian Federal authorities. We are working to add other State and Local Government authorities.</p>
<p>Please <a href="/change_request/new">contact us</a> with the name of the public authority and,
if you can find it, their contact email address if you would like to make a FOI request to them.
</p>
<p>If you'd like to help add a whole category (new state or local government region etc.) of public authority to the site, we'd love
to hear from you too.
</p>

</dd>

<dt id="authorities">Why do you include some authorities that aren't formally subject to Freedom of Information?<a href="#authorities">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
<p><%= site_name %> lets you make requests for information to a range of
organisations:</p>

<ul>
  <li> Those formally subject to the Freedom of Information Act</li>
  <li> Those which choose to voluntarily comply with the Freedom of Information Act</li>
  <li> Those which aren't subject to the Act but we think should be, on grounds
  such as them having significant public responsibilities.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In the last case, we're using the site to lobby for expansion of the
scope of the Freedom of Information Act. Even if an organisation is not legally obliged to respond
to a Freedom of Information request, they can still do so voluntarily.
</p>

</dd>

<dt id="focused">Why must I keep my request focused? <a href="#focused">#</a> </dt>

<dd>

<p>
Please put in your request only what is needed so that someone can
easily identify what information you are asking for. Please do
<i>not</i> include any of the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>arguments about your cause</li>
<li>statements that could defame or insult others</li>
<li>questions or requests for comment rather then specific information </li>
</ul>

<p>
If you do, we may have to remove your request to avoid problems with
libel law, which is a pain for both you and us.
</p>

<p>
Short, succinct messages make it easier for authorities to be clear what
information you are requesting, which means you will get a reply more quickly.
</p>

<p>
If you want information to support an argument or campaign, Freedom of
Information is a powerful tool. Although you can't use this site to
run your campaign, we encourage you to use it to get the information you
need. We also encourage to run your campaign elsewhere - one effective
and very easy way is to <%= link_to 'start your own blog',
"http://wordpress.com/"%>. You are welcome to link to your campaign
from this site in an annotation to your request (you can make
annotations after submitting the request).
</p>

</dd>

<dt id="documents">Why do I have to ask for specific existing documents? <a href="#documents">#</a> </dt>

<dd>

<p>
Australian Freedom of Information (FOI) law only gives you a right
to "documents", which is very broadly defined as information in recorded form.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to making your formal application, it needs to be in the form of
a request for existing documents &mdash; reports, briefs, memorandum, notes for file,
tenders, etc.
</p>

<p>
However, it's a mistake to ask for everything! Remember to <a href="#focused">
keep your request focused</a> and ask for specific existing documents.
</p>

</dd>

<dt id="fees">Does it cost me anything to make a request? <a href="#fees">#</a> </dt>

<dd>

<p>
  Making a Freedom of Information request is free for all Australian Government
  (Federal) Authorities.</p>
<p>
  Some State Governments may impose an applicaiton fee. See <a href="help/about#whybother_them">this table</a> for
  the differences between each state.
<p>
  A public body may choose to impose certain charges to provide the information but they can only charge you if
  you have specifically agreed in advance to pay.
</p>

<p>
  The law contains a 'lowest reasonable cost' objective, meaning that if
  the public body chooses to impose a charge it should fairly reflect the work
  involved in providing access to documents and must not be used to discourage
  you from exercising your right of access.
</p>

<p>
  If a public body decides to charge you for access to documents there are
  certain circumstances where the <a href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/publications/guidelines/Part4_Charges_for_providing_access.html#_Toc284510893">
  charges may be reduced or waived</a>, such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Releasing the information is in the general public interest</li>
  <li>The charges would cause you financial hardship (e.g. you're a pensioner)</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes an authority will refuse your request, saying that the cost
of handling it exceeds a level that would detriment their day to day work. At this point you can refine your
request. e.g. it would be much cheaper for an authority to tell you the amount
spent on marshmallows in the past year than in the past ten years.
</p>

<dt id="quickly_response">How quickly will I get a response? <a href="#quickly_response">#</a> </dt>

<dt id="no_response">What if I never get a response? <a href="#no_response">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
<p>There are several things you can do if you never get a response.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sometimes there has been a genuine problem and the authority never
    received the request. It is worth telephoning the authority and politely
    checking that they received the request. It was sent to them by email.
    </li>
    <li>If they have not received it, the problem is most likely due to
    "spam filters". Refer the authority to the measures in the answer
    '<a href="/help/officers#spam_problems">I can see a request on <%= site_name %>, but we never got it by email!</a>'
    in the FOI officers section of this help.
    </li>
    <li>If you're still having no luck, then you can ask for an internal review,
    or complain to the Information Commissioner about the authority, or both.
    Read our page '<a href="/help/unhappy">Unhappy about the response you got?</a>'.

<dt id="data_protection">Can I request information about myself? <a href="#data_protection">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
  <p>
    <strong>No</strong>. Requests made using <%= site_name %> are <strong>publicly
    visible</strong> so cannot help you find information about yourself or another private individual.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you'd like to
    <a href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/publications/fact_sheets/FOI_fact_sheet5_your_personal_information.html#access">request personal information</a>
    you can do so privately by asking the public body directly. Agencies will
    often give you this information when you ask for it or you can formally
    request it using the Privacy Act or Freedom of Information Act.

    unwittingly, in a request, please <a href="/help/contact">contact us</a>

</dd>


<dt id="multiple">Can I make the same request to lots of authorities, e.g. all departments? <a href="#multiple">#</a> </dt>

<dd>We ask you to first send a test version of your request to a few
authorities. Their responses will help you improve the wording of your request,
so that you get the best information when you send the request to all of
the authorities. If you would still like to send a bulk request to a number of authorities,

<dt id="offsite">I made a request off the site, how do I upload it to the archive? <a href="#offsite">#</a> </dt>

<dd><%= site_name %> is an archive of requests made through the site,

other requests. For one thing, we wouldn't be able to verify that other
