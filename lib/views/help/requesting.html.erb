<dd>
<p>It can be hard to untangle government's complicated structures, and work out
who knows the information that you want. Here are a few tips:
<ul>
<li>Browse or search <%= site_name %> looking for similar requests to yours.</li>
<li>When you've found an authority you think might have the information, use
the "home page" link on the right hand side of their page to check what they do
on their website.</li>
<li>Contact the authority by phone or email to ask if they hold the kind of
information you're after.</li>
<li>Don't worry excessively about getting the right authority. If you get it
wrong, they should transfer your request to the correct authority</a> for you.
</li>
<li>If you've got a thorny case, please <a href="/help/contact">contact us</a> for help.</li>
</ul>

</dd>
<dt id="who">Who can make a request? <a href="#who">#</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>
Any person, of any nationality, anywhere in the world, however young or old can make a request under Federal Australian Freedom of Information (FOI) law.
</p>
<p>
The Freedom of Information Act simply says that "every person has a legally enforceable right to obtain access in accordance with this Act". A "person" can also be a body corporate, such as a company.
</p>
</dd>

<dt id="missing_body">You're missing the public authority that I want to request from! <a href="#missing_body">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
<p>At the moment we aim to cover public authorities in the Australian Federal Government and the ACT. We plan to add more State and Local Government authorities soon.</p>
<p>If we are missing an authority from the Federal Government or the ACT, please <a href="/change_request/new">contact us</a> with the name of the public authority and,
if you can find it, their contact email address for Freedom of Information requests.
</p>
<p>If you'd like to help add a whole category (new state or local government region etc.) of public authority to the site, we'd love
to hear from you too.
</p>

</dd>

<dt id="authorities">Why do you include some authorities that aren't formally subject to Freedom of Information?<a href="#authorities">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
<p><%= site_name %> lets you make requests for information to a range of
organisations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Those formally subject to Freedom of Information</li>
  <li>Those which choose to voluntarily comply with Freedom of Information</li>
  <li>Those which aren't subject to Freedom of Information but we think should be, on grounds
  such as them having significant public responsibilities.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In the last case, we're using the site to lobby for expansion of the
scope of Freedom of Information. Even if an organisation is not legally obliged to respond
to a Freedom of Information request, they can still do so voluntarily.
</p>

</dd>

<dt id="focused">Why must I keep my request focused? <a href="#focused">#</a> </dt>

<dd>

<p>
Please put in your request only what is needed so that someone can
easily identify what information you are asking for. Please do
<i>not</i> include any of the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>arguments about your cause</li>
<li>statements that could defame or insult others</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you do, we may have to remove your request to avoid problems with
libel law, which is a pain for both you and us. Short, succinct messages
make it easier for authorities to be clear what information you are
requesting, which means you will get a reply more quickly.
</p>

<p>
If you want information to support an argument or campaign, Freedom of
Information is a powerful tool. Although you may not use this site to
run your campaign, we encourage you to use it to get the information you
need. We also encourage to run your campaign elsewhere - one effective
and very easy way is to <%= link_to 'start your own blog',
"https://wordpress.com/"%>. You are welcome to link to your campaign
from this site in an annotation to your request (you can make
annotations after submitting the request).
</p>

</dd>

<dt id="documents">Why do I have to ask for specific existing documents? <a href="#documents">#</a> </dt>

<dd>

<p>
Freedom of Information only gives you a right to "documents", which is very
broadly defined as information in recorded form.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to making your formal application, it needs to be in the form of
a request for existing documents &mdash; reports, briefs, memorandum, notes for file,
tenders, etc.
</p>

<p>
However, it's a mistake to ask for everything! Remember to <a href="#focused">
keep your request focused</a> and ask for specific existing documents.
</p>

</dd>

<dt id="fees">Does it cost me anything to make a request? <a href="#fees">#</a> </dt>

<dd>

<p>
  Making a Freedom of Information request is always free. A public body may choose to impose
  certain charges to provide the information but they can only charge you if
  you have specifically agreed in advance to pay.
</p>

<p>
  The laws contain a 'lowest reasonable cost' objective, meaning that if
  the public body chooses to impose a charge it should fairly reflect the work
  involved in providing access to documents and must not be used to discourage
  you from exercising your right of access.
</p>

<p>
  If a public body decides to charge you for access to documents there are
  certain circumstances where the charges may be reduced or waived, such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Releasing the information is in the general public interest</li>
  <li>The charges would cause you financial hardship (e.g. you're a pensioner)</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes an authority will refuse your request, saying that the cost
of handling it exceeds a level that would detriment their day to day work. At this point you can refine your
request. e.g. it would be much cheaper for an authority to tell you the amount
spent on marshmallows in the past year than in the past ten years.
</p>

<dt id="quickly_response">How quickly will I get a response? <a href="#quickly_response">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
<p>
  By law, the public authority must keep you informed about the progress of your Freedom of Information request.
</p>

<p>
  Within <strong>14 days</strong> after they receive your request they must give you
  <strong>written acknowledgement</strong> and within <strong>30 days</strong> they
  must provide you with either <strong>the documents you have asked for or a written
  decision on your request</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  For various reasons, this timeframe can be extended.
</p>

<p>
  <%= site_name %> will email you if you don't get a timely response.  You can
  then send the public authority a message to remind them, and tell them if they
  are breaking the law.
</p>

</dd>

<dt id="no_response">What if I never get a response? <a href="#no_response">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
<p>There are several things you can do if you never get a response.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sometimes there has been a genuine problem and the authority never
    received the request. It is worth telephoning the authority and politely
    checking that they received the request. It was sent to them by email.
    </li>
    <li>If they have not received it, the problem is most likely due to
    "spam filters". Refer the authority to the measures in the answer
    '<a href="/help/officers#spam_problems">I can see a request on <%= site_name %>, but we never got it by email!</a>'
    in the FOI officers section of this help.
    </li>
    <li>If you're still having no luck, then you can ask for an internal review,
    or complain to an Information Commissioner, Ombudsman, or Tribunal about the authority, or both.
    Read our page '<a href="/help/unhappy">Unhappy about the response you got?</a>'.
</ul>
</dd>

<dt id="not_satifised">What if I'm not satisfied with the response? <a href="#not_satifised">#</a> </dt>
<dd>If you didn't get the information you asked for, or you didn't get it in time,
then read our page '<a href="/help/unhappy">Unhappy about the response you got?</a>'.
</dd>

<dt id="reuse">It says I can't re-use the information I got! <a href="#reuse">#</a> </dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Authorities often add legal boilerplate about Copyright, which at first
  glance implies you may not be able do anything with the information. This is
  likely to be incorrect. For example, the latest
  <a href="http://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IntellectualProperty/Documents/StatementofIPprinciplesforAusGovagencies.pdf">
    Statement of IP Principles for Australian Government Agencies
  </a>
  explicitly encourages reuse.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Consistent with the need for free and open re-use and adaptation, public
    sector information should be licensed by agencies under the Creative
    Commons BY standard as the default.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can, of course, write articles about the information or summarise it, or
quote parts of it. We also think you should feel free to republish the
information in full, just as we do, even though in theory you might not be
allowed to do so.  See <a href="/help/officers#copyright">our policy on copyright</a>.</p>

<dt id="ico_help">Can you tell me more of the nitty gritty about the process of making requests? <a href="#ico_help">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
<p>Have a look at the Freedom of Information
<a href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/freedom-of-information/applying-the-foi-act/foi-guidelines/">guidelines</a>
and <a href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/freedom-of-information/foi-resources/freedom-of-information-fact-sheets/">fact sheets</a>
on the Information Commissioner's website.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="data_protection">Can I request information about myself? <a href="#data_protection">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
  <p>
    <strong>No</strong>. Requests made using <%= site_name %> are <strong>publicly
    visible</strong> so cannot help you find information about yourself or another private individual.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you'd like to request personal information you can do so privately by
    asking the public body directly. Agencies will often give you this
    information when you ask for it or you can formally request it using a
    relevant law.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you see that somebody has included personal information, perhaps
    unwittingly, in a request, please <a href="/help/contact">contact us</a>
    immediately so we can remove it.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt id="private_requests">I'd like to keep my request secret! (At least until I publish my story) <a href="#private_requests">#</a> </dt>

<dd><p><%= site_name %> is currently only designed for public requests. All
responses that we receive are automatically published on the website for anyone
to read.  </p>
<p>You should contact the public authority directly if you would like to
make a request in private.  If you're interested in buying a system which helps
you manage Freedom of Information requests in secret, then <a href="/help/contact">contact us</a>.
</p>
</dd>


<dt id="multiple">Can I make the same request to lots of authorities, e.g. all departments? <a href="#multiple">#</a> </dt>

<dd>We ask you to first send a test version of your request to a few
authorities. Their responses will help you improve the wording of your request,
so that you get the best information when you send the request to all of
the authorities. There is currently no automated system for sending the request
to the other authorities, you must copy and paste it by hand.

</dd>

<dt id="offsite">I made a request off the site, how do I upload it to the archive? <a href="#offsite">#</a> </dt>

<dd><%= site_name %> is an archive of requests made through the site,
and does not try to be an archive of all Freedom of Information requests. We'll never support uploading
other requests. For one thing, we wouldn't be able to verify that other
responses actually came from the authority. If this really matters to you,
you can always make the same request again via <%= site_name %>.
</dd>

<dt id="moderation">How do you moderate request annotations? <a href="#moderation">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
<p>Annotations on <%= site_name %> are to help
people get the information they want, or to give them pointers to places they
can go to help them act on it. We reserve the right to remove anything else.
</p>
<p>Endless, political discussions are not allowed.
