  <dd>To help you find out inside information about what Australian governments
  are doing.
  </dd>

  <dt id="premise">How does the site work? <a href="#premise">#</a> </dt>
  <dd>You choose the public authority that you would like information from, then
  write a brief note describing what you want to know. We then send your request
  to the public authority. Any response is automatically published on the
  website for you and anyone else to find and read.
  </dd>

  <dt id="whybother_me">Why would I bother to do this? <a href="#whybother_me">#</a> </dt>
  <dd>You pay taxes, and then government does things with the money. All sorts of
  things that affect your life, from healthcare through to national defence. Some
  it does badly, some it does well. The more we find out about how government
  works, the better able we are to make suggestions to improve the things that
  are done badly, and to celebrate the things that are done well.
  </dd>

  <dt id="whybother_them">Why would the public authority bother to reply? <a href="#whybother_them">#</a> </dt>
  <dd>By law, almost all public authorities have to respond. The response
  will either contain the information you want, or give a valid legal reason why
  it must be kept confidential.
